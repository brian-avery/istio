# Istio Release Notes

This directory contains the release notes for Istio. Every user facing change
should have a release note added in the [./notes](./notes) directory based on
the [template](./template.yaml). Before a release, the release notes utility
will be run in order to generate a release notes file which will be reviewed
by the release managers and documentation team.
